/**
 * The internal dispatch table Eng2's TOOL-ARCHITECTURE.md (§3, §5) calls for:
 * the single source of truth `list_capabilities` describes and `read`
 * dispatches against. L3 populates exactly one domain (`deen`) with exactly
 * one entity (`prayer`) — "the dispatch table matters more than the
 * coverage; L5 fans it out" (team-lead). Adding a second entity, or a
 * second domain, is adding another object to these maps, never a new code
 * path — that extensibility IS the proof this architecture works, not
 * something to demonstrate by rushing more entities in before each one's
 * been checked the way `prayer` was below.
 *
 * EVERY ENTITY'S COLUMN LISTS ARE A VISIBILITY REGISTRY, not a convenience
 * projection (memo §3): `detail`/`fields` narrow within `fullColumns`, they
 * never widen past it. A column absent from `fullColumns` is not reachable
 * by this entity no matter what the caller asks for — that is the
 * mechanism that keeps e.g. a future `user_api_keys` entity's
 * `encrypted_key` off MCP without trusting every future caller to remember
 * to ask nicely.

   * FOUND DURING THIS BUILD, NOT ASSUMED: TOOL-ARCHITECTURE.md's "`updated_at`
   * on every entity, no exceptions" is a design rule, not yet a fact about
   * the schema — grepped the full baseline + every migration and found
   * a genuine, trigger-maintained `updated_at` on exactly ONE table in the
   * entire 68-table schema (`ingestion_jobs`, migration 074's
   * `touch_updated_at()` trigger). None of `deen`'s 8 tables has one.
   * `prayers.logged_at` is used here as `prayer`'s stand-in ONLY because it
   * was verified, not assumed, to be a faithful proxy: `markPrayer`
   * (app/(app)/deen/actions.ts) is the table's ONLY write path and sets
   * `logged_at` on every upsert; `unmarkPrayer` deletes the row outright
   * rather than leaving a stale one. A future entity must not copy this
   * column name by pattern-matching — it must be verified the same way,
   * table by table, or left `null` here honestly. A fabricated
   * `updated_at` would silently break `detail:"ids"`'s entire reuse
   * promise (a row that changed would read as unchanged forever), which is
   * a worse failure than admitting the column doesn't exist.
